# Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks and TimeSeries Forecasting in Portfolio Optimization
**Abstract:**

</br>
Predicting stock market trends is key to quantitative traders to make profit and optimize their portfolios. We explore mean-variance portfolio optimization as well as multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network \& time series forecasting models to determine the best investing strategy. Using the top ten stocks in the S\&P 500 Index for our portfolio, we find that we obtain significant profit returns with the MLP model giving a 224.75\% return and the time series forecasting giving a 119.85\% return. Mean-variance optimization gives us great returns as well with a minimal-risk portfolio, strongly focusing on investing in Johnson \& Johnson given the recent COVID-19 outbreak.
